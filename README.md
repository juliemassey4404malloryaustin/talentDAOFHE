# TalentDAOFHE: A Decentralized Talent Agency for Creators ðŸš€

TalentDAOFHE serves as a revolutionary decentralized talent agency powered by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**. This innovative DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) acts as an intermediary for encrypted creators, such as anonymous artists and writers, ensuring their works and identities are protected while also facilitating private business negotiations and copyright management.

## Identifying the Challenge: Protecting Creative Talents

In todayâ€™s digital landscape, creators often face significant hurdles in maintaining their anonymity and securing fair representation. Many artists and writers struggle with the risk of exploitation and inadequate compensation for their work. The traditional publishing and creative industries can overwhelm independent talents, leaving them vulnerable to unscrupulous practices. TalentDAOFHE addresses these concerns by providing a protective infrastructure that supports the rights and identities of creators.

## How FHE Provides a Solution

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows creators to encrypt their work and identity, which can be securely managed and negotiated by the DAO on their behalf. By employing **Zama's open-source libraries**, such as **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**, TalentDAOFHE ensures that sensitive information remains confidential throughout the process of negotiation and rights management. This means that while the DAO can advocate for the rights and interests of its members, the identities and works of creators remain shielded from potential risks associated with exposure.

## Core Functionalities

TalentDAOFHE is designed with a variety of features to foster a supportive ecosystem for creators:

- **FHE Encryption of Creator Identity and Works:** Protects the anonymity of creators and keeps their intellectual property secure.
- **DAO Representation for Business Negotiations:** Acts as a trusted representative for its members during discussions about licensing and contracts.
- **Collective Bargaining Power:** Empowers creators to negotiate better terms collectively, ensuring fair compensation.
- **Creator-Centric Infrastructure:** Facilitates a seamless experience for managing proposals, projects, and negotiations within the DAO framework.

## Tech Stack

The primary technologies employed in the development of TalentDAOFHE include:

- **Solidity** for smart contract development
- **Node.js** for server-side scripting
- **Hardhat** for Ethereum development
- **Zama FHE SDK** (Concrete and TFHE-rs) for secure confidential computing
- **Ethereum** for the underlying blockchain infrastructure

```

## Installation Instructions

To set up TalentDAOFHE on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have **Node.js** installed. If you do not have it yet, please download and install it from the official Node.js website.
2. Install **Hardhat** globally if itâ€™s not already installed. This can be done with the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install --global hardhat
   ```

3. After downloading the project, navigate to the project directory in your terminal, and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

This will install all required dependencies, including the Zama FHE libraries necessary for confidential computation.

## Build & Run Your DAO

Once you have set up the project, you can compile and deploy the contract using the following commands:

### Compile the Smart Contract
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Run Tests
To ensure the integrity of the system and that the functionalities work as expected, execute the tests with:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### Deploy the Smart Contract
To deploy your smart contract to the desired Ethereum network, use:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
```

## Example Code Snippet

Hereâ€™s a simple code example showcasing how to encrypt a creator's work before submission:

```javascript
const { encrypt } = require('zama-fhe-sdk');
const creatorWork = "This is a secret artwork!";
const encryptedWork = encrypt(creatorWork);

console.log("Encrypted Work: ", encryptedWork);
```

In this example, the creator's work is encrypted using the Zama SDK, ensuring that the DAO can handle it without compromising the identity and content.
